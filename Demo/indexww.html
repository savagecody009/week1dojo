                Walter Hartwell White, Sr., also known by his alias 
                Heisenberg, is the main villainous protagonist of the 
                television series Breaking Bad. He also appears in a 
                flashback scene in El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie.
                A brilliant but underachieving chemist working as a 
                high school science teacher, Walt is diagnosed with 
                terminal lung cancer, which spurs him on to use his 
                chemistry knowledge to cook and sell crystal meth 
                to provide for his family after his imminent death.</p>
